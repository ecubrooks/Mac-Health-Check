# Mac Health Check (3.2.0)

> Another pleasant update to the practical, MDM-agnostic, user-friendly approach to surfacing Mac compliance information directly to end-users via your MDM's self-service app

## Overview

Mac Health Check provides a practical, MDM-agnostic, user-friendly approach to surfacing Mac compliance information directly to end-users via an MDM's Self Service.

Built using the open-source utility [swiftDialog](https://github.com/swiftDialog/swiftDialog/wiki), the solution acts as a “heads-up display” that presents real-time system health and policy compliance status in a clear and interactive format.

Deployment of Mac Health Check involves configuring organizational defaults, embedding the script in your MDM, creating a policy to run it on demand and testing to ensure proper output and behavior.

Administrators can customize the user interface using swiftDialog’s visual capabilities, making the experience both informative and approachable.

The tool logs results for review, while not altering device configuration, and a new "Silent" Operation Mode makes Mac Health Check ideal for IT visibility without end-user intrusion.

## Use Cases

Mac Health Check is particularly valuable in IT support workflows, serving as an initial triage point for Tier 1 support by confirming network access, credentials, and MDM connectivity, while also acting as a verification tool for Tier 2 teams both during and after remediation efforts.

### Step Zero for Tier 1

- User has a working Internet connection
- User knows their directory credentials
- Mac can execute policies
- Validates Network Access Controls

### Step Ninety-nine for Tier 2

- Initial assessment for support sessions
- Easily confirms remediation efforts
- Provides peace-of-mind for end-users

### Silent Mode

- Silently performs all health checks and logs results
- No dialog is presented to the end-user
- Ideal for background compliance reporting
- Complements existing MDM compliance frameworks

### Dock Integration

- Non-`Silent` modes launch swiftDialog with `--showdockicon` and `--dockicon`
- `dockIcon` is configurable and supports `default`, local paths, `file://` paths and `http(s)` URLs
- Mac Health Check copies `Dialog.app` to `/Library/Application Support/Dialog/${humanReadableScriptName}.app` and launches `dialogcli` from that bundle so Dock hover text matches the script name
- `dockiconbadge` shows the number of remaining checks, decreases after each completed check and is removed when checks complete
- If dock icon setup fails, Mac Health Check logs a warning and falls back to the default `/usr/local/bin/dialog` launch path

## Features
The following health checks and information reporting are included in version `3.2.0`, which operates in `Self Service` mode by default. (Change `operationMode` to `Debug`, `Development` or `Test` when getting ready to deploy in production.)

> :new: Mac Health Check version `3.2.0` introduces a new persistent notification of failed health checks, which remains visible until user-dismissed

#### IT Support
- Dynamic `supportLabel1` / `supportValue1` through `supportLabel6` / `supportValue6`
- Empty Label / Value pairs are skipped automatically
- Legacy fallback still works when all dynamic pairs are empty:
  - Telephone (`supportTeamPhone`)
  - Email (`supportTeamEmail`)
  - Website (`supportTeamWebsite`)
  - Knowledge Base Article (`supportKBURL`)
- Info button target now uses the first URL-like dynamic support value; if none is found, it falls back to legacy Knowledge Base values

#### User Information
- Full Name
- User Name

## Operation Mode: Development

A new "Development" Operation Mode has been added to aid in developing Health Checks, allowing the easy execution of a _single_ Health Check.

<img src="images/MHC_3.0.0_Development_1.png" alt="Health Checks" width="800"/>
<img src="images/MHC_3.0.0_Development_2.png" alt="Health Checks" width="800"/>

When `operationMode` is set to `Development`, a dedicated `developmentListitemJSON` is used to allow developers to focus on specific checks, instead of running the entire suite.

```zsh

if [[ "${operationMode}" == "Development" ]]; then
    
    notice "Operation Mode is ${operationMode}; using ${operationMode} dialogJSONFile template."

    # Development List Items

    developmentListitemJSON='
    [

    ]
    '
    # Validate developmentListitemJSON is valid JSON
    if ! echo "$developmentListitemJSON" | jq . >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "Error: developmentListitemJSON is invalid JSON"
        echo "$developmentListitemJSON"
        exit 1
    else
        combinedJSON=$( jq -n --argjson dialog "$mainDialogJSON" --argjson listitems "$developmentListitemJSON" '$dialog + { "listitem": $listitems }' )
    fi

else
```

Additionally, the matching Health Check functions are executed:

```zsh
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
# Generate Health Checks based on Operation Mode and MDM Vendor (where "n" represents the listitem order)
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

if [[ "${operationMode}" == "Development" ]]; then
    
    # Operation Mode: Development
    notice "Operation Mode is ${operationMode}; using ${operationMode}-specific Health Check."
    dialogUpdate "title: ${humanReadableScriptName} (${scriptVersion})<br>Operation Mode: ${operationMode}"
    checkAirDropSettings "0"
    checkNetworkHosts "1" "Jamf Hosts" "${jamfHosts[@]}"
    checkFreeDiskSpace "2"
    checkUserDirectorySizeItems "3" "Desktop" "desktopcomputer.and.macbook" "Desktop"
    checkUserDirectorySizeItems "4" "Downloads" "arrow.down.circle.fill" "Downloads"
    checkUserDirectorySizeItems "5" ".Trash" "trash.fill" "Trash"

else
```
