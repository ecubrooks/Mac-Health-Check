## Mac Health Check

**Author**: Dan K. Snelson  
**Date**: 2026-02-17  
**Version**: 3.0.0  
**Status**: In Progress

---


## Executive Summary

**One-Sentence Description**: [Mac Health Check](http://snelson.us/mhc) is a user-friendly `zsh` script that surfaces Mac compliance and health information directly to end-users via MDM Self Service portals, using [swiftDialog](https://swiftdialog.app) for interactive feedback.

**Problem Statement**: IT organizations need a practical, automated, and transparent way to communicate device compliance, configuration, and health status to end-users, reducing support tickets and improving security posture.

**Target Audience**: IT administrators, end-users (employees), and support staff in organizations managing Macs with MDM solutions.

**Primary Value Proposition**: Provides actionable, real-time compliance and health information to users and IT, improving device security, user empowerment, and support efficiency.

## Project Overview

### Purpose

Mac Health Check exists to bridge the gap between IT compliance requirements and end-user awareness by providing a clear, actionable summary of Mac health and compliance status. It enables organizations to surface critical device information, automate checks, and empower users to self-remediate issues, all within the familiar context of their MDM's Self Service portal.

### Goals

1. Surface real-time Mac compliance and health information to end-users and IT.
2. Support multiple MDM vendors and environments (MDM-agnostic design).
3. Provide actionable, user-friendly feedback and remediation guidance via swiftDialog.
4. Enable easy extensibility for new checks and organizational branding.

### Non-Goals

1. Not a full device management or remediation tool—focuses on reporting and guidance, not enforcement.
2. Does not replace MDM or EDR solutions; complements them.
3. Does not support platforms other than macOS.

### Success Criteria

How will we know this project is successful?

- [ ] End-users can view their Mac's compliance and health status in Self Service.
- [ ] IT can reduce support tickets related to compliance confusion.
- [ ] Script runs reliably across supported macOS versions and MDMs.
- [ ] Users receive clear, actionable remediation steps for common issues.

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: End-User Compliance Check
**Actor**: End-user (employee)
**Context**: User opens MDM Self Service and launches Mac Health Check.
**Goal**: Understand current compliance and health status of their Mac.
**Steps:**
1. User launches Mac Health Check from Self Service.
2. Script runs pre-flight checks and gathers system information.
3. swiftDialog displays compliance status, health checks, and remediation guidance.
**Expected Outcome**: User sees a clear summary of their Mac’s status and any required actions.

#### Use Case 2: IT Support Troubleshooting
**Actor**: IT support staff
**Context**: User reports an issue; IT asks user to run Mac Health Check and report results.
**Goal**: Quickly diagnose compliance or configuration issues remotely.
**Steps:**
1. IT instructs user to run Mac Health Check.
2. User shares results or screenshot with IT.
3. IT uses output to guide troubleshooting or remediation.
**Expected Outcome**: IT can efficiently identify and resolve user issues.

### Secondary Use Cases
- Automated compliance reporting for audits
- Testing new health checks in Development mode

### Anti-Use Cases
- Running on non-macOS platforms
- Automated remediation without user awareness

---


## Technical Constraints

### Must Have
- macOS (tested on recent versions, e.g., 12+)
- swiftDialog (minimum version 2.5.6.4805)
- jq (for JSON parsing)
- Root privileges to run system checks
- MDM integration (Addigy, Filewave, Fleet, Kandji, Jamf Pro, JumpCloud, Microsoft Intune, Mosyle, or generic)

### Assumptions
- Users have access to MDM Self Service
- swiftDialog and jq are installed or installable
- Script is run as root (enforced by pre-flight check)
- Network connectivity for some checks (e.g., VPN, webhook)

### Limitations
- Only surfaces information; does not enforce compliance
- Some checks may not be applicable to all organizations
- Requires user interaction for full UI experience
- Not designed for non-macOS systems

### Dependencies
#### External Dependencies
- swiftDialog: User interface
- jq: JSON parsing
- MDM Self Service: Script delivery and launch
#### Internal Dependencies
- Organization-specific branding, support info, and compliance messages

## Architecture & Design

### High-Level Architecture

The script is a modular, MDM-agnostic Zsh script that collects system, user, and compliance data, then presents it to the user via swiftDialog. It supports multiple MDMs, organizational branding, and extensible health checks. Logging and webhook integration provide IT with audit and alerting capabilities.

## Implementation Approach

### Technology Stack
- **Primary Language**: Zsh (macOS shell scripting)
- **Key Libraries/Frameworks**:
    - swiftDialog (user interface)
    - jq (JSON parsing)
- **Build Tools**: None (interpreted script)
- **Testing Framework**: Manual and script-based validation

### File Structure
```
Mac-Health-Check/
├── Mac-Health-Check.zsh         # Main script
├── Resources/
│   └── projectPlan.md           # Project plan (this file)
│   └── [branding, images, etc.]
├── [MDM-specific folders]/       # (if needed)
├── README.md
└── ...
```

### Core Algorithms/Logic
#### Algorithm 1: Pre-flight Checks
**Purpose**: Ensure environment is ready before running checks
**Approach**:
1. Check for root privileges
2. Validate/install swiftDialog and jq
3. Initialize logging
**Edge Cases**:
- Missing dependencies → Fatal error, exit
- Not root → Fatal error, exit

#### Algorithm 2: Health Check Execution
**Purpose**: Gather and report compliance/health status
**Approach**:
1. Collect system/user/MDM info
2. Run modular health checks (disk, OS, VPN, etc.)
3. Build JSON for swiftDialog
4. Display results and remediation
**Edge Cases**:
- Incomplete data → Show warning/error in dialog
- MDM not detected → Use generic checks

### Configuration Strategy
**User-Configurable Settings**:
- `operationMode` - [Default: Self Service] - Controls script mode (Debug, Development, Silent, etc.)
- `organizationBrandingBannerURL` - [Default: sample image] - Branding
- `allowedMinimumFreeDiskPercentage` - [Default: 10] - Disk compliance threshold
- `vpnClientVendor` - [Default: paloalto] - VPN check type
**Configuration Method**: Script parameters, variable overrides, environment variables
**Configuration Validation**: Pre-flight checks and fatal errors for invalid/missing config

---


## Testing Strategy

### Test Modes
- **Development Mode**: Enables testing of individual health checks and verbose output
- **Test Mode**: Runs all checks with test data/parameters
- **Production Mode**: Default; runs in Self Service for end-users

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: User runs script, all checks pass, dialog displays green status
2. **Edge Cases**:
    - Missing swiftDialog/jq
    - Not run as root
    - MDM not detected
    - VPN not connected
3. **Error Conditions**:
    - Health check fails (e.g., FileVault off, disk space low)
    - JSON validation fails
4. **Performance**: Script completes in reasonable time (<1 minute typical)

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Script runs as root
- [ ] swiftDialog and jq present or installed
- [ ] All health checks execute and report status
- [ ] UI displays correctly for all supported MDMs

---


## Error Handling

### Error Categories
1. **User Errors**: Not running as root, launching outside Self Service (fatal, exit with message)
2. **System Errors**: Missing dependencies, failed system commands (fatal or warning, exit or display in dialog)
3. **Configuration Errors**: Invalid or missing config/branding (fatal, exit)
4. **Network Errors**: Webhook or VPN checks fail (warning, shown in dialog)

### Error Response Strategy
**Fatal Errors** (stop execution):
- Not root, missing swiftDialog/jq, invalid JSON → Exit with error message
**Recoverable Errors** (continue with warning):
- Health check fails, network unavailable → Show warning in dialog, log warning
**Silent Failures** (log but continue):
- Non-critical info missing (e.g., optional branding) → Log and continue

### Logging Strategy
**Log Levels**:
- ERROR: Fatal/system errors
- WARNING: Health check or recoverable issues
- NOTICE: Key script events
- INFO: General progress
- DEBUG: Only in Debug mode
**Log Location**: /var/log/org.churchofjesuschrist.log
**Log Format**: Timestamped, prefixed by log level and event

## Security Considerations
### Authentication/Authorization
- Script must be run as root (enforced by pre-flight check)
- No user authentication; relies on MDM Self Service for access control
### Sensitive Data Handling
- Does not collect or transmit sensitive user data
- Webhook URLs (if used) are passed as parameters, not stored
### Input Validation
- Validates all required parameters and dependencies at runtime
- Ensures only valid JSON is passed to swiftDialog
### Privilege Requirements
- Requires root privileges for system checks and some commands

---


## Deployment Strategy
### Prerequisites
**System Requirements**:
- OS: macOS 12 or later (tested on recent versions)
- Dependencies: swiftDialog (2.5.6.4805+), jq
- Permissions: root access
**Preparation Steps**:

2. Configure branding and thresholds as needed
3. Deploy script via MDM Self Service
### Installation Process
1. Copy Mac-Health-Check.zsh to deployment location
2. Set executable permissions
3. Add to MDM Self Service catalog
### Configuration Process
1. Set script parameters for branding, thresholds, etc.
2. Test in Development mode
3. Move to Production/Self Service mode
### Verification Process
