# Mac Health Check (3.2.0)
## External Checks

This directory contains scripts that perform external checks for the services of various third-party applications. 

These checks are designed to be run in conjunction with the main Mac Health Check script to ensure comprehensive health checks.

![External Checks](../images/external_checks.png)

External checks leverage code you’ve already written, simply added to a new, single-script Jamf Pro policy.

1. The code of an existing Extension Attribute …
1. … is saved as a Script in your Jamf Pro server.
1. This script is then added to a simple Jamf Pro policy, with a custom Trigger.

This custom Trigger and the path to the app itself — so that its icon can be displayed to the end-user — is then specified in Mac Health Check:

```
checkExternalJamfPro "12" "symvBeyondTrustPMfM" "/Applications/PrivilegeManagement.app"
checkExternalJamfPro "13" "symvCiscoUmbrella" "/Applications/Cisco/Cisco Secure Client.app"
checkExternalJamfPro "14" "symvCrowdStrikeFalcon" "/Applications/Falcon.app"
checkExternalJamfPro "15" "symvGlobalProtect" "/Applications/GlobalProtect.app"
```

When the policy successfully executes, the returned output must include the keyword `Running`, meaning the service which you’re checking is running.

```
*"Running"* ) 
    dialogUpdate "listitem: index: ${1}, status: success, statustext: Running"
    info "${appPath} Running"
    ;;
```
